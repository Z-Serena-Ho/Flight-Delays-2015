# Airline Twitter Sentiments of February 2015
Like the delay data, the Twitter research was sourced from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crowdflower/twitter-airline-sentiment/data

In this preliminary analysis, I noted that Delta and Southwest had a higher amount of delays than the other airlines, ranging in the 10,000s. However, the negative sentiments were greater for the big competitors United and American. Even more odd is that Southwest had much less Late Flight reasons than most others (the exception is Virgin America, a much smaller airline at the time).

It is possible that the data has been oversimplified. A 10-minute delay is weighed the same as a 2-hour delay. Every complaint is also weighed equally regardless of the confidence metric. I also have not checked yet if the delays include any international flights originating/arriving in the United States. If they are not included, then it's possible that United et al. actually had more delays than Southwest. To clarify, Southwest does have international routes but they are more limited, e.g. there are no trips to Europe.

If the data is assumed to be accurate, then it could be a difference in policy that affects customer satisfaction.
